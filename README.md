## Description

Welcome to our second two-day project in week 3 of Intermediate
JavaScript at [Epicodus](https://epicodus.com).

We started it on Wednesday February 9th 2022 from [this project's
lesson](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/intermediate-javascript/asynchrony-and-apis/martian-weather-bike-index-api-of-choice-two-day-project)
in the [curriculum](https://learnhowtoprogram.com/).

This project uses the [Nomics Crypto
API](https://p.nomics.com/cryptocurrency-bitcoin-api).

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Fork the project to your own Github repository if you plan to make
  changes._

* _Clone the project from your repo to your machine or preferred
  location and cd into its folder._

* _[Get an API Key](https://p.nomics.com/cryptocurrency-bitcoin-api)
  and retain [the
  attribution](https://p.nomics.com/pricing#attribution) we've
  included in our HTML for personal use._

* _You'll need the Node Package Manager (npm) to build the project. To
  set it up, install [Node JS](https://nodejs.org) for your platform._

* _Install webpack and other packages listed above and in package.json
  and type:_
  
  ```$ npm install```

* The decision to install specific, OLD, versions of these packages
  was dictated by the curriculum assignment.

* By default, the packages are installed locally to the project
  folder. That way, if you decide to not continue with the project,
  you can cleanly remove it and all its dependencies by just deleting
  the project folder.

* _Build and bundle the project from the src/ folder into the dist/
  folder with:_
  
  ```$ npm run build```
  
  _To just build it; or run 'npm run start' to build it and start the 
  local Webpack server._

* _If you like this project, please contribute issues and especially
  pull requests to improve it._

## Known Bugs
